# Ori Gamepad Remapper
Configuration of the gamepad for Ori and Blind Forest DE can be pretty hard, that is why I have implemented this tool that can help you to configure any button layout as you like.

Requires at least **.Net Framework 4.5** to run

I have implemented it with Visual Studio 2015 but I think any higher version should be fine. Required NuGet packages - SharpDx and SharpDx.DirectInput

Application modifies file %AppData%\Local\Ori and the Blind Forest DE\ControllerButtonRemaps.txt. And it will be good idea to backup it somewhere before doing any manipulation with this application
